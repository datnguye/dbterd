## Reporting a Vulnerability

The repository is currently enabled with [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Once any security pops up, `dbterd` maintainer will be responsible to make an update and might release the patches if necessarily.

Otherwise, please help to explicitly raise the awareness via [Report a security vulnerability issue](https://github.com/datnguye/dbterd/security/advisories/new/?title=[SEC]).
